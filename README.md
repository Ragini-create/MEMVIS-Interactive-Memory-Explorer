# MEMVIS-Interactive-Memory-Explorer
MEMVIS is a web-based educational simulator that visually demonstrates how strings are stored and managed in computer memory. It converts abstract memory concepts into interactive animations, helping students clearly understand how memory works at a low level.
## Problem Statement
Understanding how strings are stored and managed in memory is difficult for beginners because memory operations happen invisibly inside the system.MEMVIS solves this problem by providing a visual, step-by-step simulation of memory behavior.
## Objectives
Visualize how strings are stored character-by-character.
Demonstrate memory addresses, null termination (\0), and memory flow.
Show difference between Stack and Heap memory behavior.
Illustrate how memory is freed and compacted.
Enable searching of characters inside memory.
